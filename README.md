# AngulIt - Multi-Stage CAPTCHA Application

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.0.

## Project Overview

AngulIt is a comprehensive Angular application that implements a multi-stage CAPTCHA challenge system. This project serves as a learning platform for Angular development, covering essential concepts like component architecture, state management, routing, and form validation.

### Features
- Multi-stage CAPTCHA challenges (image selection, math problems, text input)
- State management with NgRx
- Form validation and user input handling
- Progress persistence across page refreshes
- Route guards for secure navigation
- Responsive design with animations

### Learning Objectives
- Master Angular component development
- Understand state management patterns
- Implement reactive forms and validation
- Configure routing and navigation guards
- Apply Angular best practices and testing

## Documentation

**For detailed learning materials and step-by-step implementation guides, see the [Documentation](./docs/README.md).**

The `/docs` directory contains comprehensive documentation for each issue implementation, including:
- Angular concepts explained
- Code examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting guides
- Learning resources

## Quick Start

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
